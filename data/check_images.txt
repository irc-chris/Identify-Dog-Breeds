Answer: Yes.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: From just those four images, I'd say resnet and vgg performed about the same. So I'd pick either of them
        over alexnet. They were better because they were able to distinguish between German Shepherd and Belgian
        Malinoise (which made me happy because those are the type of dogs I have!), which even a lot of humans
        can't do. I added an image of a Malinoise puppy, which interestingly alexnet caught that one though it
        didn't catch the adults in the previous pictures. Considering the output from the pet-images, clearly vgg
        was the best CNN architecture. It had the overall highest correct percentages. 100% correct dogs, 100%
        correct non-dogs, 93.3% correct breeds, 87.5% correct matches.
